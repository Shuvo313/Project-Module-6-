Pagination: Pagination is the process of displaying the data on multiple pages rather than showing them on a single page. You usually do pagination when there is a database with numerous records. Dividing those records increases the readability of the data. It can retrieve this data as per the userâ€™s requests.

SELECT ACCOUNT_ID, AVAIL_BALANCE, STATUS, OPEN_BRANCH_ID
FROM account
WHERE OPEN_BRANCH_ID = 2
ORDER BY ACCOUNT_ID ASC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 0;

E)
SELECT OPEN_BRANCH_ID, COUNT(DISTINCT OPEN_BRANCH_ID) + 1 AS total_branches_including_head
FROM ACCOUNT
WHERE OPEN_BRANCH_ID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY OPEN_BRANCH_ID;
